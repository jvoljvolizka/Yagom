## Yet another Golang server monitor 

It's simple stupid and unnecessary just like my life 

### Todo
_________________________________________________________________________________

* Fix server side error handling _shouldn't be any panic in encryption/decryption functions_
* Actually write some monitoring code _maybe with go-osstat?_
* Tidy the code as multiple files
* Write client front end code with tview library
* Write a better README file 
* Don't kill yourself
